In this tutorial, we will set an automated pipeline to build a Next.js Docker image and then push it to GitLab container registry. We will start by creating our `ci` file and then register a runner to execute our pipelines.

As always, here is the [official documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/tutorials/create_register_first_runner/) link.

# Prerequisites

The only thing required is a GitLab project containing our **source code** and **Dockerfile**.

# GitLab Runners

### Overview

A GitLab Runner is an open source application that executes the jobs of a pipeline. We can install this program in four different ways:

* Local server
    
* Docker container
    
* VM
    
* Cloud Provider
    

For this example we will use a **Docker container**, as it simplifies the whole process.

Runners can also be categorized as:

1. **Shared:** All project in a GitLab instance can use this Runner
    
2. **Group:** All projects in a specific group can use this Runner
    
3. **Project:** Only a specific project can use this Runner
    

For this example we will create a Runner that will be assigned to a specific **Project**.

### Executors

Now that we know what Runners are, let's dive a bit deeper on how they work. An executor is the environment on which our pipeline will run. These also come in different flavors, so some examples include:

* Virtual Box
    
* Shell
    
* Docker
    
* Kubernetes
    
* ...
    

So for example, a **Shell** executor will run the pipeline directly on the host shell, a **Docker** executor will create a container to execute the pipeline and so on.

Yes, we will be using a **Docker executor**. Good guess!

# Creating our CI/CD

Time to start implementing our pipeline. In order to do that we need to take a few setup steps. These include:

1. Create a ci `.yml` file
    
2. Create a Runner container
    
3. Register the Runner to the GitLab project
    

### 1\. Starting with the ci file

In order to run a pipeline on a GitLab project we need to create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file on the root of our project's source code.

Let's see an example:

```yaml
variables: 
  DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR: "/certs"

docker-build:
    image: docker:latest
    stage: build
    services:
        - docker:dind
    script:
        - echo $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD | docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER $CI_REGISTRY --password-stdin
        - docker build -t $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:latest .
        - docker push $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:latest
```

Here's what's going on:

* The `docker-build` job uses the latest image of Docker as base image
    
* We name this stage `build`
    
* `dind` (‚ÄúDocker-in-Docker‚Äù) means running Docker within a Docker container. Thus, a new Docker engine is spawned within a container, providing an isolated environment for managing containers.
    
* After that, we begin our script commands:
    
    1. We login to our repository's registry using the `docker login` command. Notice how we can directly pull the `PASSWORD` , `USER` and `REGISTRY` variables from the platform.
        
    2. We build our application image
        
    3. We push the image to the repository registry
        

You can find more information in the official documentation:

* [Run your CI/CD jobs in Docker containers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/docker/using_docker_images.html)
    
* [Use Docker to build Docker images](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/docker/using_docker_build.html#use-docker-in-docker)
    

### 2\. Creating our Runner container

As we previously said, we need to create a docker container that has the Runner software listening for requests. Using a `docker-compose.yml` file we can describe the service like so:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  gitlab-runner:
    image: gitlab/gitlab-runner:alpine
    container_name: gitlab-runner
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```

The only thing to notice here is how we mount the host `docker.sock` inside the container, in order to be utilized by the Runner service.

Then we simply `docker compose up -d` !

### 3\. Register the Runner

And the final part is to register our Runner on the GitLab repository. Here's what we need to do:

Firs navigate to your GitLab project **Settings &gt; CI/CD** and expand the **Runners** tab. Here we need to create a new project Runner configuration. Click on the **New project runner** button.

The configuration needed for this is:

1. **Select Linux** as operating system
    
2. Provide a **Runner description**
    
3. Check the **Run untagged jobs**, as we won't be using tags

After clicking the submit button, our Runner configuration is ready. The important thing to keep here is the `--url` parameter provided by GitLab, as well as the `--token`

Great, now we just need to register this configuration to our Runner container!

To do that we need to enter the container shell so that we can execute the register command. To do that type:

```bash
docker exec -it <container-name> bash
```

Now, inside the Runner container, we execute the following command:

```bash
gitlab-runner register -n \
  --url "URL" \
  --registration-token REGISTRATION_TOKEN \
  --executor docker \
  --description "My Docker Runner" \
  --docker-image "docker:24.0.5" \
  --docker-privileged \
  --docker-volumes "/certs/client"
```

# Running the pipeline

That was it! üéâ

The Runner is registered and all that's left to do is run our pipeline. We can do that from the project **CI/CD &gt; Pipelines** tab.

After the image gets built, it will be automatically to our GitLab container registry with the tag `:latest`.

Till next time! ‚úåÔ∏è
